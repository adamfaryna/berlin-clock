[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adamfaryna/berlin-clock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adamfaryna/berlin-clock)

## Introduction

This simple app demonstrates use of React.js + Webpack + ES6 + Sass + Gulp.js, Yeoman, BrowserSync and couple more.

It is based on brilliant [Fountain Webapp Generator](https://github.com/FountainJS/generator-fountain-webapp).

It is created with use of SOLID and TDD principles - at least I hope so.
